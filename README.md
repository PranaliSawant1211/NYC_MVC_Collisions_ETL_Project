## ðŸ§© Key Features

- âœ… **Data Profiling & Cleansing**  
  Used **Alteryx Designer** to perform detailed data profiling, handle missing values, normalize data formats, and eliminate outliers to ensure high-quality input for further transformation.

- âœ… **Data Transformation**  
  Created modular workflows in **Alteryx** to aggregate, filter, and enrich traffic incident records across multiple boroughs, time periods, and vehicle types.

- âœ… **ETL Automation with Talend**  
  Built reusable **Talend ETL workflows** to automate data ingestion, transformation, and loading into target destinations, enabling daily refreshes of collision datasets.

- âœ… **Performance Improvement**  
  Reduced report refresh time **from days to hours**, streamlining access to consistent and clean data for dashboards and reporting teams.
